## Run The App

**Start the development server:**

To start the Expo development server, run:

```bash
npx expo start
```

**Run the app:**

For iOS: Using your device Camera scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or in the Expo DevTools in your browser. Open the Expo Go app on your physical iOS device. If you don't have Expo Go installed, you can download it from the App Store.

For Android: Open the Expo Go app on your physical Android device and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or in the Expo DevTools in your browser. If you don't have Expo Go installed, you can download it from the Google Play Store.

Make sure your device and development server are on the same WiFi network:

For Expo Go to connect successfully, your development server (the machine running the Expo CLI) and your physical device should be on the same Wi-Fi network.

## Troubleshooting

If the app does not load, ensure that your device and development server are on the same network. Check the terminal for any error messages that might provide more information on issues you encounter.
